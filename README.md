# Flat Design Calculator

## Project Overview
This project is a **basic calculator** built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library. It features a **modern flat design** UI with an **orange and white color scheme**. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with functionalities like clear, backspace, and result evaluation. 

The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive calculator with a modern interface, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear and Backspace**: Clear the entry field or remove the last character entered.
- **Result Evaluation**: Display the result of the arithmetic expression entered by the user.
- **Modern Flat UI**: Clean and minimalist interface with a gray and orange color scheme.
- **Responsive Layout**: The application resizes appropriately based on the window size.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user in case of invalid expressions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: The main programming language used to develop the application.
- **Tkinter**: Pythonâ€™s built-in library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI).
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Used to bind actions like button clicks to specific functions.
- **Grid Layout**: Ensures the application layout adapts responsively.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine. Tkinter comes bundled with Python, so you do not need to install it separately.

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the Python file (`flat_calculator.py`).
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flat-design-calculator.git
